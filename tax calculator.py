#### needs to be like above "what have you earned this year", but then run through the next if statements (one for income and NI deductions).
# calculation from that should be taken away from the actual CIS deduction taken


### new idea - use a float input naming convention
# i.e.
# a = floatinput("what have you earned this year")
# b = floatinput("Please enter total amount of allowable expenses")
# c = floatinput("How much have you paid in CIS deductions from 04/22 - 04/23")
# yearlyincome = a - b
# yearlyincome ifs (if yearlyincome <= 12570:
#                                       tax = (yearlyincome *0.0))
# c
